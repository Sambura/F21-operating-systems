What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address?

I believe that the names of addresses are pretty self-explanatory. 
Virtual address is the address to the cell in the virtual memory,
whereas physical address points to the physical memory cell in RAM.

From here we can say, that any physicall address can be converted 
into virtual, but not all virtual addresses can be converted to physical,
since physical RAM stores only a part of virtual memory.
