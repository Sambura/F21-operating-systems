660 means permission 6 for owner and for the group, for other users - the permission is 0. permission 6 is 2 + 4 => 110 => RWx (only read and write is permitted). Permission 0 is obviously 000 => rwx (no permissions)

775 means permission 7 for owner and for the group, for other users - the permission is 5. permission 7 is 4 + 2 + 1 => 111 => RWX (everything is permitted). Permission 5 is 4 + 1 => RwX (no write permission)

777 means permission 7 for all users, that is, any user has full set of permissions
